# YADSMan
 A tool for writing Yet Another Dialogue System files (and yes that's a format I'm making myself)

# Currently very much quite very early in development
Buuuut you can [follow the development over on here](https://trello.com/invite/b/67d230a9b1ce14ab6dc4897f/ATTIed95a7d338f3ff567d90db6dd5d887ad88539793/yads-yet-another-dialogue-system) if you want to :3

## In the future...
Super cool Godot plugin that can parse and display a YADS file with minimal & flexible setup
